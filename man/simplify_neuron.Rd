\title{Simplify a neuron to the longest tree with n branch points}
\usage{
simplify_neuron(x, n = 1, invert = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[nat]{neuron}} to simplify}

\item{n}{Required number of branch points (default=1, minimum 0)}

\item{invert}{Whether to keep the simplified backbone (when
\code{invert=FALSE}, the default) or its inverse.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored)}
}
\value{
The simplified \code{neuron} or the untouched original neuron for
  neurons that have <=n branch points.
}
\description{
Simplify a neuron to the longest tree with n branch points
}
\details{
If the neuron already contains fewer than or exactly the requested
  number of branches, then the original neuron is returned. The approach is
  to build up the new neuron starting from the longest tree including no
  branches all the way up to the longest tree containing n branches. The
  distance calculations are only carried out once so it should be reasonably
  efficient. Nevertheless at each iteration, the longest path from the tree
  so far to the newly selected leaf is calculated and it is likely that this
  step could be avoided. Furthermore for large values of n, pruning excess
  branches rather than building would presumably be more efficient.
