Description: This package is a reboot of the AnalysisSuite
    (https://github.com/jefferis/AnalysisSuite) bundle of R code that I have
    been using for a number of years to analyse and visualise 3D biological
    image data, especially traced neurons. AnalysisSuite provides functions to
    read/write a variety of 3D image formats including Amira, NRRD and Biorad
    PIC and can interact with the CMTK and IRTK image registration suites.
    There is read/write functionality for neuron tracings including SWC,
    Amiramesh (lineset and skeletonize), Neurolucida ASC. These data can then
    be visualised (including in 3D via rgl) or analysed including applying
    calculated registrations from image data to neuron tracings. There is also
    some recent functionality for representing image data for neurons that have
    been skeletonised but not formally traced. This representation also allows
    morphological comparison with neurons including searches/clustering. The
    plan is to clean up the core code and move it into the nat package. Then
    additional functionality will be added over time to nat.* extension
    packages. One package nat.as will be used solely to make it rather easier
    to install the AnalysisSuite code bundle.
